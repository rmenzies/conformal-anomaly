# Conformal Predictors
Conformal predictors (CP) provide the ability to make predictions with a level of confidence. A very clear and concise description can be found here https://cml.rhul.ac.uk/cp.html, written by the inventors of CP: Professor Alex Gammerman and Professor Vladimir Vovk.
# Anomaly Discovery
Using conformal predictors on different ML algorithms in Python to discover anomalies and potentially new class labels.
